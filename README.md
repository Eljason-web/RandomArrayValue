Write a Java program that generates an array of 15 random integers in the range from -20 to 20 (inclusive). The program should:
Display the original array, with each number on a separate line.
Compute and display the following statistics:
Minimum value
Maximum value
Sum of all elements
Average (as a decimal number)
Count of negative numbers (values less than 0)
Sort the array in ascending order and display the sorted version, with each number on a separate line.
Use the Random class to generate values, and Arrays.sort() for sorting. Ensure the average is calculated accurately using floating-point division.
